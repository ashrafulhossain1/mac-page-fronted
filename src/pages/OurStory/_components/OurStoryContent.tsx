                    Each year, thousands of students and professionals move from abroad or
                    within Ireland, whether for education, career advancement, or a fresh
                    start. These transitions come with the need for temporary,
                    medium-term accommodation, lasting from a few months to a couple of
                    years.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Back in 2014, we realised that finding medium-term let accommodation
                    that balances affordability, comfort, and flexibility was very
                    difficult. Traditional accommodation options were limited to only two
                    choices: expensive short-term stays in hotels or permanent leases.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Recognising this need, we founded Hosting Power in Dublin in June 2014
                    with a clear mission:{" "}
                    <strong className="text-gray-900">
                        to put medium-term rentals on the map.
                    </strong>
                </p>

                <p className="font-semibold text-gray-900">
                    While doing so, we've remained committed to two core beliefs that
                    guide everything we do:
                </p>

                <ul className="list-disc pl-6 space-y-3">
                    <li>
                        We believe that medium-term rentals are an essential option in the
                        accommodation market. The choices shouldn't be limited to two
                        extremes—expensive hotels or permanent leases.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Temporary medium-term lets should offer the same standards as
                        permanent accommodations. Temporary housing should never mean having
                        to accept substandard accommodation or pay inflated prices.
                    </li>
                </ul>
