Terms and Conditions

Please read these Terms and Conditions carefully as they contain important information about your legal rights, remedies and obligations relating to your use of the Warm Welcome Platform. By accessing or using the Warm Welcome Platform, you agree to comply with and be bound by these Terms and Conditions.
These Terms and Conditions constitute a legally binding agreement between Warm Welcome and you, the Host and between Warm Welcome and you, the Guest. These Terms and Conditions set out the rights and obligations of the Guest to be hosted by a Host in Ireland as well as the rights and obligations of the Host to host Guests in their home, in Ireland.

Modification Of These Terms
Warm Welcome (LTD)  reserves the right to modify these Terms and Conditions at any time in accordance with this provision. In the event of changes, we will post the revised Terms and Conditions on the Warm Welcome Platform and update the 'Last Updated' date at the end of this paragraph, specifying the altered subject. Continued access to or use of the Warm Welcome Platform and services will constitute acceptance of the revised Terms and Conditions. Last updated: 28/02/2026.


Scope Of Hosting Power Ltd Services
Warm Welcome is an online platform facilitating hosts in Ireland to rent out accommodations to guests. Our platform offers guests an online marketplace to book rooms for the duration of their studies, work placements (internships), or work contracts (if any). Bookings must have a minimum duration of one month (defined as 28 days) and can last up to 24 months.

Warm Welcome acts as a platform where listings are advertised for Hosts at no charge to the Host, enabling them to offer their rooms up as accommodation to Guests. Warm Welcome creates, uploads and manages all the listings on the Warm Welcome Platform on behalf of the Hosts.

If you choose to use the Warm Welcome Platform to either list your accommodation as a Host or to book a room as a Guest, your relationship with Warm Welcome is limited to being an independent, third-party contractor, and not an employee, agent, joint venturer or partner of Warm Welcome for any reason, and you act exclusively on your own behalf and for your own benefit, and not on behalf, or for the benefit, of Warm Welcome. Warm Welcome does not, and shall not be deemed to, direct or control you generally or in your performance under these Terms and Conditions specifically. You acknowledge and agree that you have complete discretion whether your accommodation is listed on the Warm Welcome Platform.
To promote the Warm Welcome Platform and to increase the exposure of listings to potential Guests, listings and other user (both Host and Guest) content may be displayed on other websites, in applications, within emails, and in online and offline advertisements.



Eligibility, Using the Warm Welcome Platform
Users must be at least 18 years old and capable of entering into legally binding agreements to access and use the Warm Welcome Platform, both as a Host and a Guest. By accessing or using the Warm Welcome Platform, users affirm that they are 18 years old or older, possessing the legal capacity and authority to enter into such agreements.

The sole exception applies where a user, acting as a guest, is 17 years of age at the time of making a booking but will attain the age of 18 no later than the scheduled date of check-in. In such circumstances, the user may validly proceed with the reservation and shall be deemed legally bound by the terms of the booking.

In the event of a reservation for two guests sharing the same room, the individual initiating the booking, providing contact details and a valid copy of identification, is designated as the primary guest. The primary guest assumes full responsibility for the entire booking process. The second guest must also be 18 years of age or older, and it is explicitly the duty of the primary guest to verify the accuracy of the first and last name, along with all information concerning the second guest as indicated during the booking request.
In accordance with Warm Welcome's terms and conditions, it is imperative to emphasize that bookings on our platform must be made directly by the user intending to stay in the rented accommodation, referred to as the Guest. Warm Welcome strictly prohibits bookings made on behalf of third parties, including but not limited to employers, internship agencies, schools, and relatives. The booking process and communication are to be conducted exclusively by the Guest who will physically occupy the room or studio using the personal and private email address and other contact details from the guest occupying the room. This policy ensures clarity and transparency in the booking process, aligning with our commitment to fostering direct relationships between Hosts and Guests on our platform. Any attempt to circumvent this policy may result in the cancellation of the booking and may lead to further actions in line with Warm Welcome's terms and conditions.
 
While user verification on the Internet presents challenges, we do not assume responsibility for confirming the identity of any Host or Guest. Nevertheless, for transparency and fraud prevention purposes, and in compliance with applicable laws, we reserve the right to:
i. Request Guests or Hosts to provide government identification or other information or conduct additional checks to verify their identities or backgrounds.
ii. Screen Guests and Hosts using third-party databases or other sources, and request reports from service providers.
iii. Obtain reports from public records of criminal convictions or sex offender registrations or equivalent background checks, where sufficient information is available to identify Guests and Hosts.
We aim to prioritize safety and security within our platform while acknowledging the limitations of online verification methods.

Terms & Conditions Part One: GUEST

Warm Welcome provides Guests with a platform to book accommodation for the duration of their studies, work placement or work contract (if any). Guest's studies, work placements, or work contracts (if any) must have a minimum duration of one month (defined as 28 days) in accordance with the minimum booking length permitted. Guests who are in the process of signing up for a school or securing a job must clearly indicate this in their application and book for a duration aligned with the authorized minimum length or their best estimation of the duration of their future studies or work.
 
By booking accommodation through the Warm Welcome Platform, you, as the Guest, agree to abide by the following Terms & Conditions. You affirm that all the information provided is accurate and truthful. Additionally, you acknowledge that there is no reason that would prevent you from being placed in one of the Host accommodations listed on our platform.

Hosts rely on the accuracy of the information provided during your bookings based on the information that guests have provided when accepting a booking. Therefore, by accepting the terms and conditions you hereby certify that all of the information you have provided in this application (or any other accompanying or required documents) is correct, accurate, and complete to the best of your knowledge. Falsification, misrepresentation, or omission of relevant facts for your stay in your guest description will result in the cancellation of the booking with no refund of the service fee (for example; if you have not included that you are intending to bring a pet with you (which is never permitted), that you are working or studying from home, that you intend to share the room with a friend; or if you have indicated any inaccurate information such as the name of your school or company etc).

Booking With Warm Welcome
The Warm Welcome website is designed to help the Guest find the most suitable accommodation for their stay according to the location of the property and needs of the Guest. Upon receipt of a booking confirmation from Warm Welcome, an agreement is formed between the Guest and the Host. Warm Welcome cannot guarantee to fulfil all the expectations of each individual Guest. Warm Welcome guarantees that all the Hosts have been either met face to face or, if the property has not been physically visited, the host has been required to provide information and photos about their property. Whether the host has been visited or not will be clearly indicated on each listing next to "Property Status" under the section "More Information".
Warm Welcome only find and list Hosts that:
- Are willing to welcome and host Guests.
- Have a clean house with a safe and comfortable atmosphere.
- Offer a bedroom based on private occupancy on par with current Irish standards.
- Have a bathroom that is maintained in a clean and hygienic condition, that is easily accessible at all times, and that includes a functioning sink, as well as a bath or shower.

Account Creation / One Account per User Policy
To ensure the integrity and fairness of our platform, we allow only one account per user. Upon submitting a booking request on Warm Welcome, an account will be automatically created for the user, using the personal data provided by the guest. This personal data includes your First Name, Last Name, Date of Birth, Email Address and Phone Number. By providing this personal data, the user affirms that it is their own and correct personal data and that this is the only personal data they will use on our website. Users are responsible for ensuring that they only have one account and therefore are not permitted to make additional booking requests using different personal data (such as a different first name or a different email address) as it may result in the creation of multiple accounts and be considered a violation of our single account policy. Users who attempt to do so may have all their accounts suspended or terminated. By agreeing to these terms and conditions, users waive any right to a refund of their service fees in the event of a double booking caused by multiple accounts for the same user.

Communication Protocols and Privacy Measures
To uphold the utmost privacy and security of our Guests, Warm Welcome places great importance on safeguarding their personal information. Therefore, we will exclusively respond to specific queries related to a confirmed booking or a booking request if the inquiry is received from the same email address used for initiating the booking. This stringent measure is in place to ensure that only the authorized Guest, as identified by their registered email, has access to pertinent details about their accommodation arrangements.
In the event that the email address initially used by the Guest to initiate the booking becomes inaccessible, a change of email address is permissible. To facilitate this change, the Guest must clearly explain the situation by contacting support@warmwelcome.ie. Additionally, the request for a change in email address must be accompanied by a valid copy of identification, ensuring it matches the other contact details provided in the original booking request. 
 
Transfer of Bookings
In order to ensure the safety and security of all our users, confirmed bookings on Warm Welcome are not transferable to another person. The user who makes the booking must be the same person (or the same two people in case of 2-guest bookings) who uses the service, for the entire period of the booking. Partial transfers of the booking for a limited period of time to another person are also not allowed. Any attempt to transfer a booking to another person will result in the cancellation of the booking without refund of the service fee.

Multiple Booking Requests:
If a guest submits multiple booking requests, the first host to accept will automatically confirm the booking. This confirmation will automatically close any other pending requests with other hosts. At this time, the service fee will be charged and is non-refundable.  



Definition of Rentals
Guests can utilize the Warm Welcome Platform/Website to book various rental options categorized as: a room with a shared bathroom (1); a room with a private bathroom (2); or a self-contained unit (3).

A room with a shared bathroom is defined as a private furnished room which consists of, at least, one storage space (such as a wardrobe, chest of drawers, shelves, shelving unit, clothing rack or under-bed storage), a bed, lighting, a heating unit, and 2 sets of bed linen.

The room will be for the sole and private use of the guest(s) booking the room. The bed must be a standard bed or a convertible bed with a comfortable mattress (air mattress or overused mattress etc are not accepted). The guest should also have access to a shared kitchen and a washing machine with designated space to dry their clothes in addition to the rental of the room.

While microwaves or ovens may be a good addition, they are not mandatory, and these appliances alone do not meet the minimum requirement needed for cooking a diverse range of meals. It is imperative that the kitchen is equipped with a functional sink for water access. While access to hot water is mandatory for the shower or bath, it is not required for kitchen or bathroom sinks.

The studio / self contained unit offered must be a permanent structure constructed with durable materials, such as bricks, concrete, or similar materials, ensuring immobility and permanence. This accommodation cannot be a mobile home, caravan, or any movable structure.


Guest Room/Studio Care and Hygiene Standards
We kindly ask our guests to keep their allocated bedrooms or studios clean, tidy, and well-maintained throughout their stay. To ensure proper hygiene, food consumption in the bedroom is strictly prohibited. Additionally, guests are requested to open their windows for ventilation at least once a day for 5 to 10 minutes to maintain air quality and prevent moisture buildup (see section below for more details on ventilation). Furthermore, it's advised to change and launder bed linens, including sheets and pillowcases, within a maximum timeframe of one to two weeks to maintain optimal hygiene. Please take note that failure to adhere to these standards may lead to the termination of the placement by the host. In such instances, the service fee won't be refunded.

Ventilation and Air Quality in the Allocated Rooms and Studios
As recommended by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), proper ventilation is essential for optimising indoor air quality, preventing excess moisture, and maintaining a healthy environment for both the room and its guests. It is the responsibility of each guest to open the window of their allocated room or studio at least once a day for a minimum of 5 to 10 minutes, allowing fresh air to circulate and maintaining optimal air quality. This daily practice helps prevent issues such as condensation, mould growth, and other related concerns, ensuring a comfortable and safe living space.

Some guests may wish to use devices such as humidifiers or air purifiers. However, it is important to note that these devices are not a substitute for daily window ventilation. Guests must inform their hosts in advance if they intend to use such devices, particularly, but not limited to, electrical ones, as these may pose security risks. The host reserves the right to approve or decline the use of these devices based on the circumstances. If the use of these devices is deemed necessary for health reasons, guests must indicate this in their booking request description so the host is aware of the requirement before accepting or declining the booking.

Failure to comply with the ventilation guidelines will be considered a breach of the Terms and Conditions, and any resulting damage to the room or studio will be the guest's responsibility.
 
Guest Room Privacy
Guest privacy is very important and the room allocated to the guest is to be considered their own private room for the entire duration of their stay. 
Accordingly, the host can only access the guest's room for safety purposes, such as checking if no electrical appliances such as radiators were left on, if the window was properly closed, if the room is kept tidy etc.
 
Location of the Property
The location is clearly displayed in each listing, providing enough information for each guest to decide if the location of the property is suitable for them. Each listing includes the name of the district the property is located in (eg: Marino, Dublin 3) in addition to a map showing the area where the property is located via a circle with a circumference of 3km.   
It is the responsibility of each guest to check that the location is suitable for their stay before making any booking request. 

Remote Location and Vehicle Needed
Some of our hosts are not living within walking distance of public transport.
For the properties located in more remote areas with no public transport available, it will be clearly indicated in the listing description, under "The Location", that guests must have their own vehicle to request the property. 
It is the responsibility of each guest to check the location description of each listing to make sure it is suitable for their stay before making any booking request. 
If a guest decides to cancel a confirmed booking — or if the host must cancel due to the guest not having their own means of transport (despite the property description clearly stating that a personal vehicle is required) — the standard refund policy will apply, and the service fee cannot be refunded in full under these circumstances.

Remote Work or Study  
Some of our hosts are happy to allow guests to work or study remotely from their property, however, this is not suitable for every host.
It is the responsibility of each guest to provide accurate information about their study or work situation and avoid any misrepresentation or omission of facts if they are planning to work or study from the host's property.
 
If a school or company name is indicated on the description with no further information provided by the guest, it will be assumed that the guest is working or studying full-time at the address of the company or school mentioned. 
 
For a work-from-home request to be valid, the guest must accurately specify the number of days per week they intend to work or study from home in their booking request. This specified duration must correspond with their actual usage once they are residing on the property. In the absence of such specification, it will be presumed that the guest intends to work or study from home full-time, Monday to Friday, during standard office hours.
 
If a guest or host cancels a confirmed booking due to the host’s refusal to permit work or study from the property, and this work or study from home was either not disclosed in the booking request or if the disclosed information was misleading (e.g., the guest is working or studying more than specified),the service fee will not be refunded in full under those circumstances.

Guests with Physical Conditions, Disabilities, or Injuries
Ensuring an inclusive and comfortable experience for all our guests is paramount to us. If you have any physical conditions, disabilities, or injuries that necessitate special equipment or specific property arrangements (such as wheelchair accessibility or the absence of stairs), it is crucial to include this information in your self-description. This enables us to match you with a property that aligns with your needs.
In the event that a guest chooses to cancel a booking due to the property not being adequately adapted to their physical condition, injury, or disability, or if a host cancels the booking for the same reason, and the guest's self-description did not mention the physical condition, injury, or disability, the service fee will not be refunded in full under those circumstances. It is the guest's responsibility to provide accurate and complete information regarding their special requirements. This ensures that hosts can make informed decisions about accepting booking requests, only doing so when they are equipped to cater to specific needs.

Use Of Household Products
All the cleaning and food products that the Guests use for their own needs (i.e.: washing powder or cooking oil) must be bought by the Guests themselves. It is not permitted for the Guest to use any products that do not belong to them. 

Food Restriction Policy
The host reserves the right to restrict the preparation or consumption of particular foods on the property premises based on considerations such as allergies, personal beliefs, environmental concerns or animal welfare principles. This may encompass items like meat, fish, eggs, and dairy products.
Strong-smelling items, including specific spices, may also be subject to strict restrictions, especially if any member of the household experiences asthma, respiratory problems, or is very sensitive to the air quality in close environments. Guests are required to explicitly communicate their preferences for specific food types in their booking request if those foods are essential for their consumption.
It's important to note that guests who choose to cancel their reservation due to cooking and consumption restrictions on specific products imposed by the host will not be eligible for a full refund, provided that the restricted food type was not indicated as essential by the guest in their booking request.

Host's Pets
Some of the Hosts live with a pet, usually, a cat or a dog, who is considered to be a part of the family. Any listing that does have a pet is identified as such per the most up to date information received by Warm Welcome. However, it is important to note that the pet information is for reference only as the pet situation might have recently changed/might change during the guest's stay, or the host might have friends occasionally visiting with their pets. It is the responsibility of the guest to clearly indicate in their self-description if they suffer from allergies to dogs or cats so the host is fully aware of it before accepting or declining their request. In the event of a guest cancelling their booking due to a pet allergy, or a host cancelling a booking due to a guest's allergy, the guest will not be eligible for a full refund of the service fee if this allergy was not clearly mentioned in their booking request or guest description.

Guests Are Not Permitted to Bring Pets
Guests are strictly not permitted to bring pets to any of our rentals. All properties have a firm no-pet policy for guests.
This policy is in place for important safety and hygiene reasons — including allergy concerns, the risk of property damage, and to maintain a clean, comfortable environment for all guests and hosts.
If a guest submits a booking request without disclosing their intention to bring a pet, or later attempts to bring one, the booking will be immediately cancelled without refund of the service fee.

Smoking Policy
Guests are strictly prohibited from smoking in any part of the indoor premises. Smoking is only allowed in designated outdoor spaces, if available. This policy includes all forms of smoking, such as cigarettes, cigars, pipes, electronic cigarettes, and any other smoking devices.
 
Alcohol and Drug Use Policy
By booking this property, guests explicitly agree not to consume any illegal drugs and also refrain from storing or consuming any alcoholic beverages within the booked property at any time during their stay. Furthermore, guests are strictly prohibited from entering the property while under the influence of alcohol or drugs that may have been consumed outside the property. The host reserves the immediate right to terminate the placement with immediate effect if such an event were to occur.
Termination under these circumstances will result in the service fee paid not being refunded. Additionally, they will not be allowed to place a new paid booking request on our platform.
This policy is of utmost importance to ensure the safety of all our guests, hosts, and other occupants of the property. The understanding and adherence to this policy contribute to creating a safe, healthy, and pleasant experience for everyone residing in the property.

Host's Environment and Profile
Every host is unique, with a different story and background. They may or may not have children, be a single mother or father, live alone, have varying marital statuses, or be working or retired. Warm Welcome Hosts offer insight into local culture and the growing diversity of Ireland. Guests are expected to respect and understand these differences. Information on our listings regarding the host's profile and environment is the most up-to-date information available to Warm Welcome. However, it is important to note that the host's profile and environment information is for reference only, as their situation may have recently changed or could change during the guest's stay (such as a new person who recently moved in or a person who recently left the household). It is the responsibility of the guest to clearly indicate in their self-description if they require a specific environment due to specific needs. This ensures that the host is fully aware of the guest's needs before accepting or declining their request.
 
Host's Address Usage Policy
Guests are allowed to use the host's address for essential administrative purposes, specifically for Visa requirements, opening a bank account in Ireland, and applying for the PPS number.
For non-essential matters like receiving parcels, private correspondence, etc., guests must seek prior authorization from the host. It is expected that guests keep the volume of mail sent to the host's address low. The host can refuse guests the use of their address for purposes outside of the three essential ones listed above.
Additionally, guests are not allowed to send any letters or parcels to the host's address before their check-in.


Once The Booking is Confirmed, The Guest Agrees To:
- Contact the Host within 48 hours of the receiving the booking confirmation in order to exchange details and arrange the check in.
- Check in on the day they have booked
- Inform the Host of their schedule, if it affects the Host.
- Respect the house rules as set by Warm Welcome, together with any additional, reasonable, house rules that the Host may have in place regarding the bathroom, kitchen, internet, sitting room, TV and personal belongings.
- Keep your room clean and tidy at all times. The Guests are responsible for washing their personal clothes, towels, linen and for washing up their dishes after use. The cleaning rules of the common areas are to be discussed with the Host and must be shared equally by all occupants.
- Respect the laundry rules as regards to the days and times for when this service is available and number of weekly loads allowed. See the section "Laundry Facilities Policy" below for full details.
- Not use the landline, except in the case of a emergency.
- Inform the Host in advance if they are going to be away for two or more consecutive days.
- Inform the Host of any known medical conditions, allergies, necessary medication or emergency procedures that must be followed in case of a medical crisis.
- To not consume or partake in the consumption of any illegal drugs. It is strictly forbidden to consume or use any drugs which are illegal under Irish law for the duration of your stay.
- Assume all responsibility for any house damage that you have caused.
- Behave in an appropriate manner at all times.
- Not have any visitor at the house for the duration of your stay. Having a visitor is strictly not allowed. You are not permitted to bring anyone into the house at any time during your stay.  
- Not to consume any food in the Guest’s allocated bedroom. All food must be consumed in the kitchen or dining area.
- Not store or consume any alcohol on the property at any time during their stay.
 
Guest's Belongings and Personal Means of Transportation
In order to maintain a comfortable and uncluttered environment for all, guests are not allowed to bring excessive amounts of personal items. Excessive personal items are defined as those exceeding the combined volume of 2 standard-sized suitcases. Personal furniture, cooking utensils or large items of any kind, which are not crucial for the guest's studies or work, cannot be stored on the host's property.

If a guest needs to bring a large item essential for their studies or work such as a musical instrument, computer monitors, specific sports equipment such as an exercise bike, or a particular piece of furniture like a desk or office chair, they must clearly state this requirement in their booking request. This is to ensure that the host is aware and can make an informed decision regarding the booking request, especially if the property lacks the necessary storage space.

In the event that a guest possesses a large item crucial for their studies or work, such as a large musical instrument or computer monitors, or owns a bike, an electric bike or an electric scooter as a means of transportation, it is imperative for the guest to explicitly disclose this requirement in their booking request. Hosts, understanding the significance of such items, are open to accommodating these needs whenever possible. However, it is crucial for guests to communicate this information upfront, enabling hosts to make informed decisions based on available space in the designated room and the overall property.

Whether the cancellation is initiated by the guest or the host due to the refusal of large items — and such details were not disclosed in the initial booking request — the service fee will not be refunded in full. This policy ensures transparency and allows hosts to manage their space appropriately, while giving guests the opportunity to secure accommodations that match their specific needs.

Storage Space & Stored Item Rules
Guests must be provided with at least one storage space in their room, such as a wardrobe, chest of drawers, shelves, shelving unit, clothing rack, or under-bed storage.
If the host has limited storage options elsewhere in the property, they may use additional available storage space in the guest's room for their own belongings. However, this must be for items that are not used frequently. The host must limit access to the guest's room to retrieve these items to an absolute minimum, ensuring the guest’s privacy is respected.
 
Low Noise Policy
We kindly request all Guests and Hosts to refrain from creating noise disturbances between the hours of 10 PM and 7 AM. This period is designated for quiet hours to accommodate those who may be sleeping. Please note that this includes refraining from taking showers after 10 PM or before 7 AM if the property is equipped with a showering system that may be particularly noisy when in use, such as electric showers, power showers, or mixer showers etc.

Furthermore, guests and hosts are prohibited, at any hour of the day or night, from generating noise at an unreasonable level, except in cases of truly unavoidable and exceptional circumstances. We kindly ask all parties to be considerate of their fellow residents and to actively contribute to maintaining a peaceful atmosphere within the property.


Use of the Kitchen
We value guests having access to the kitchen in order to prepare healthy meals for themselves. However, guests must strictly adhere to the following rules while using the kitchen.

a) Guests are welcome to use the kitchen and kitchen utensils to cook their meals during the following times:
- From 6 am to 9 am (breakfast) - From 12 noon to 2 pm (lunch) - From 5 pm to 10 pm (dinner).
b) Cooking is not allowed outside of these cooking hours.
c) Cooking hours can be further restricted from the times above if the host or other guests need to prepare their own meals. In such cases, the host must clearly inform each guest about the exact time they can use the kitchen while allowing every guest a reasonable amount of time to cook and eat their meals.
d) Guests will still have access to the kitchen outside of the cooking hours to access the fridge or to prepare themselves a sandwich etc.
e) Guests are expected to clean their dishes immediately after having their meals and to leave the kitchen clean.
f) The kitchen is to be used for cooking and eating purposes only, it is not permitted to study etc. in the kitchen.


WiFi / Internet Access in the Property
Many properties listed on our website do have a WiFi connection available. WiFi when available is included in the rent and hosts aren't allowed to charge any extra cost to the guests for the use of the WiFi connection. 

It is important to note that due to some very affordable (from €12.99 a month) and high speed unlimited Mobile Data Plans now being available in Ireland, it is getting more and more common to find properties without WiFi/internet access. These Mobile Data Plans can be subscribed to by anyone living in Ireland, even temporarily, as they can be cancelled at any time.

Any listing that does have WiFi available is identified as such per the most up to date information received by Warm Welcome. However, it is important to note that the WiFi information is for reference only as the WiFi/internet access situation of the property might have recently changed/might change during the guest's stay. It is the responsibility of the guest to clearly indicate in their self-description if they do specifically require WiFi to be available in the property so the host is fully aware of it before accepting or declining their request. In the event of a guest cancelling their booking due to WiFi not being available, the service fee is not refundable in full if the WiFi request was not clearly indicated by the guest on their booking request in the guest description. 

Laundry Facilities Policy
a) Washing Machine:
The Hosts are required to provide Guests with access to a washing machine within the property. Guests are responsible for laundering their personal clothes, towels, and linens, necessitating use of the provided washing machine. The number of weekly washes is limited to 2 (twice a week) for environmental conservation and compliance with the washing machine manufacturer's recommendations regarding optimal load size. This bi-weekly usage includes all Guest's personal clothes, bed linens, and towels. The Host retains the right to establish specific times and rules for washing machine usage, ensuring they permit reasonable access. The Host has the option to manage the Guest's laundry on their behalf, provided that such assistance is undertaken only with the explicit consent of the Guest. It is crucial to understand that Guests can decline this service for privacy reasons and may decide to handle their own laundry themselves.
 
b) Dryer and Drying Rack:
The Hosts are not obligated to grant Guests access to the dryer (if available), but they must allocate a space where Guests can dry their clothes. Alternatively, Guests may be allowed to dry their clothes in their room if suitable. The Host is required to provide Guests with access to suitable drying rack equipment.
 
Heating, Energy and Water Use
Hosts are required to maintain a sufficient temperature in the house during the coldest months of the year by heating the house in the evenings and early mornings.

Guests must be mindful of appropriate heating, energy and water savings by:
- Not requesting that their host maintain unreasonable room temperatures. As recommended by the SEAI*, the temperature in the living area should not exceed 20°C and the temperature in bedrooms should be between 15 and 18°C. 
- Not requesting heating outside of the heating hours (eg: if guests choose to stay home during the day on weekdays to study or work).
- Not changing heating settings themselves; any necessary changes must be requested to be made by the hosts.
- Not installing nor using any of their own heating devices.
- Switching off all appliances when not using them and turning off all lights when leaving a room.

* SEAI is Ireland's national sustainable energy authority. They were founded in 2002 to address environmental challenges and help households and communities to use less energy. 
 
Charging of Electric Bikes and Electric Scooters
The rental fee paid to your host includes the charging of common essential devices such as smartphones and laptops. However, please note that electric scooters and electric bikes are not considered essential devices and require a separate arrangement.
 
Charging any electric scooter or electric bike without prior discussion and agreement with the host is strictly prohibited and constitutes a breach of the terms and conditions of your booking. It is essential to discuss and agree upon the charging terms with your host in advance. This includes determining the applicable charges based on factors such as duration and power consumption. These extra charges, when accepted by both the guest and the host, will be in addition to the regular weekly fee.
 
Please note that a host reserves the right to refuse the charging of electric scooters or bikes, even if a guest offers to pay an additional fee, if it was not clearly indicated in the guest's description that the guest owns or plans to acquire such a device during their stay. Therefore, it is essential that a guest who owns a bicycle or an electric scooter, or plans to acquire one for their own transportation, must clearly state this information in the guest's description. This is to ensure that the host is aware and can make an informed decision regarding the booking request, especially if the property lacks storage space or if the charging of the electric bike or scooter may cause an issue or be not possible.
 
Visitors
Guests are strictly prohibited from bringing visitors to the property, at any time during their stay. Asking the Host to make an exception on this rule will be considered a breach of the Warm Welcome Terms and Conditions.


Duration Of Stay  
Warm Welcome provides accommodations for Guests booking stays for the duration of their study, work placement, or work contract. These studies, work placements, or work contracts must have a minimum duration of one month (defined as 28 days) complying with the authorized minimum booking length. Additionally, booking lengths are limited to a maximum of 24 months.
 
Guests in the process of enrolling in a school or securing a job must estimate and book a duration based on the anticipated length of their future studies or work.
 
Extension of Stays
Guests can request an extension of their stay beyond the initially booked period through their guest account for the same property by using the 'Extend Booking' option. An administration fee of €20 and a daily fee of €1.01 per extra day will be applicable for finalizing the extended stay.
 
However, it's advisable for guests to book their entire duration for studies, work placements, or work contracts since extensions are subject to availability and cannot be guaranteed. If a guest cancels because the dates no longer suit them, or if a host cancels after the guest informs them that they need different dates from the original booking, the service fee will not be refunded in full.

Room Allocation Policy
The Host is committed to providing the Guest with the specific room as indicated in the listing. Failure to do so will be considered a breach of the Terms & Conditions by the Host.
However, the following exceptions are considered compliant with the Terms & Conditions, even if a different room is offered:
- In the event that an alternative room is allocated but constitutes an upgrade (larger size, private ensuite bathroom instead of a shared bathroom, etc.) or is similar (same size and same bathroom situation, etc.) to the initially reserved accommodation, and is provided at the same rental price.
- Similarly, a room that has undergone renovation for improvement purposes will also not be classified as a different room.
- If the Host informs the Guest prior to check-in that a different room will be allocated, and the Guest accepts this alternative, the booking will proceed as planned, and the room will no longer be considered different following the Guest's acceptance.

Absence During Christmas Holidays Acknowledgment
If a guest has indicated their absence during the Christmas Holidays by selecting 'I will be away for Christmas Holidays' from the relevant drop-down menu in their application request, they acknowledge and agree not to occupy their designated room or be present at the property between the 24th of December and the 1st of January. By choosing this option, the guest confirms their understanding that the room will remain unoccupied and unavailable for their use throughout this specified timeframe. Please note, however, that guests are permitted to leave their belongings at the property during this period, despite their absence.
 
Payment
The Guest will pay a single service fee to Warm Welcome  in order to secure the booking. The rent will then be paid directly to the Host on a weekly basis.

The Service Fee
The service fee is a non-refundable once-off fee charged at the time the booking is confirmed. It covers all the services provided by , including at least and not limited to the booking of the room for the duration selected by the guest, the contact details of the host, the information provided about the property, the pictures provided, the establishment of clear rules protecting the guest, the documents provided such as the detailed invoice which can be used as a proof of address, the permanent assistance available to the guest regarding any questions or issues relating to the accommodation from the time of booking until the end of the Guest's stay. For some listings it also includes the verification of the property which may be through a visit of the property or by requesting identify proof from the host. The service fee is calculated according to the duration of the Guest's stay. For your security, we only accept debit/credit card or PayPal payments. All tax is included.
 
Service Fee Calculation 
Our service fee includes a fixed booking fee (subject to price variation) applied universally to all reservations regardless of the booked duration, alongside a daily fee of €1.00 for each reserved day. This structure aims to ensure fairness across all stays, specifically avoiding any disadvantage for guests choosing longer durations, which may be up to 24 months. To calculate the exact amount of the service fee, please select your arrival and departure dates, then select your room of choice and click on 'Book Now'. The amount of the service fee to be paid for your specific stay will be displayed under Your Booking Information box.
 
Non-Refundable Service Fee for Breach of Terms and Conditions
No refund, partial or total, of the service fee will be provided to guests breaching the terms and conditions of their booking. This will also apply to guests having their booking terminated earlier by the host due to the guest breaching the terms and conditions.

Early Termination Initiated by The Guest
We understand that a guest may decide or need to leave before the end of the check-out date they selected and which was confirmed by their host—whether for personal reasons or unexpected circumstances outside of their control. The following rules will apply:

a) Guests are required to give their host the longest notice possible if they know they are leaving earlier than their booked check-out date. While we understand that providing a long notice period may not always be feasible, this notice must be at least 14 days.
b) To be valid, early departure notice must be sent by email to both the host and Warm Welcome at support@warmwelcome.ie, clearly stating the new departure date. This allows us to promptly re-advertise the room on the host’s behalf.
c) If a guest provides no notice at all and leaves the property earlier than their booked check-out date with immediate effect, the rent will remain due for 7 days from the date they left the property. 
For example: If a guest departs without notice 3 days after paying their 7-day weekly rent, an additional 3 days of rent will be charged to meet the required 7-day notice period.
d) If a guest provides notice, but it is less than 7 days before their early departure, rent will remain due for the number of days falling short of the 7-day notice period.
For example: If the guest gives 6 days’ notice, they will be charged 1 extra day of rent beyond the new departure date.
e) It is to be noted that even in cases where a guest fails to provide notice or provides less than the required 7 days’ notice, if the original check-out date is less than 7 days from the new departure date, rent will only be due up to the original check-out date.
For example: If the original check-out is in 4 days and the guest leaves immediately without giving any notice, rent is due for those 4 days—not 7.
f) The notice requirement may be waived if the guest leaves early due to a significant breach of terms by the host, provided the guest clearly informs the host of the issue and the host has either refused or failed to resolve it.
g) In cases of a proven significant breach by the Host, and where the issue was clearly communicated by the Guest to both the Host and Warm Welcome but not resolved, the Guest will receive a refund for the unused remaining weeks of the service fee they paid, if they decide to leave early. This refund will be calculated based on the remaining weeks from their confirmed check-out date.

Refund Policy for Host-Initiated Early Termination or Host Breach of Terms
If a host ends a guest’s stay early without the guest breaching the terms and conditions, or if a guest departs early due to a significant breach of terms by the host—where the guest has clearly informed the host of the issue, and the host has either refused or is unable to resolve it—a pro-rated refund of the service fee will be issued as follows:
 
a) If the guest has stayed in the property for 28 days or less – The refund will include both the Booking Fee and the Daily Fee, prorated based on the number of unused days of their booking..
b) If the guest has stayed in the property for 29 days or more – Only the Daily Fee will be refunded, as the Booking Fee, which applies to all stays (including those for guests with the minimum bookable stay of 28 days), has already been used. The refund will therefore consist solely of the reimbursement of the Daily Fee for the unused period, calculated at a rate of €1.00 per unused day.
c) If the guest has breached the terms and conditions – No refund, whether partial or full, will be issued if the stay is terminated early due to the guest breaching the terms and conditions.


Rental Fee
The Guest will pay their rent on a weekly basis directly to the Host. The amount of the rental fee will vary by listing, according to the location of the property and the type of accommodation on offer. This price will be clearly indicated to the Guest before the booking. The payment for the first weeks stay with the Host must be paid upfront by the Guest, on the day of their arrival. Each subsequent payment will be made on a weekly basis, on the same day of the week that the Guest arrived on, to the Host, until the end of the placement. 

Payment Method
By default, rent is payable in cash. If there is no specific agreement or discussion between the Host and the Guest regarding the payment method, cash will be the method of payment for the entire duration of the Guest's stay. However, upon mutual agreement between the host and the guest, the method of payment can be changed to a bank transfer. In the case of a bank transfer, the guest must initiate the transfer on the due date of their weekly rent (and not before). If the transfer of funds to the host's bank account is not instant (such as with online banks like Revolut, etc.), the guest must provide proof to their host, on the day the weekly rent is due, that the bank transfer has been made, in the form of a screenshot or payment confirmation document from their bank.
 
Deposit
1 - Deposit Collect at Check-in and Purpose: 
The guest is required to provide a deposit as stated in the deposit form on the day of arrival. The Host is responsible for collecting and refunding the deposit directly to the Guest during the check-out.
 
The deposit is designed to provide protection for the host against potential damages caused by the Guest during their stay to the property or to any of the property's items. Additionally, it covers any missing past rental payments for the duration the guest has stayed at the property.
 
Please note that this deposit serves a distinct purpose as indicated in this document and should under no circumstances be treated as an additional payment for room rental, nor be retained to address other matters that may arise between the Guest and the Host.
 
Please note that the deposit cannot be used by the guest as a substitute for the final week’s rent payment.


2 - Deposit Retention for Early Departure Without Notice:
Guests are required to provide formal notice to the host at least 2 weeks before their revised departure date if they plan to leave the accommodation earlier than their confirmed check-out date. If a guest departs early without giving the required 2-weeks notice minimum, the host may retain the deposit to cover the rental loss resulting from the early check-out.
 
Guests should send their notice to the host in writing, either by email or text message, and should retain a copy of the notice for their records.
 
Exceptions When Notice Is Not Required:
a) The host has breached the Terms and Conditions of the booking, leading to the guest’s early departure.
b) The host has exhibited unwelcoming behaviour towards the guest, causing the guest to leave early.
c) The host has formally requested or suggested that the guest leave before the end of their booked stay.
 
Note that the guest must provide the host with clear and detailed information supporting one or more of the reasons above if they believe they are entitled to receive their deposit back without giving the 1-week notice.


3 - Deposit Return Procedure and Potential Damages Check:
During check-out, both the Guest and the Host must inspect the guest's allocated bedroom together.

If no damage is identified, the deposit must be returned in full to the guest immediately after the check-out is completed.

In the Event That Damages Are Discovered:
- If any damage is discovered, or if any pre-existing damage to the property or its items has been directly caused by the Guest, the Host and the Guest should document it together, including taking photographs for records.
- The Host and the Guest must then work together to make a realistic estimate of the repair costs, which can be done through an internet search or by consulting professionals qualified to repair the damage.
- If the repair cost is less than the deposit amount, the remaining balance must be returned to the guest.
- If the repair cost exceeds the deposit amount, the Host should contact their home insurance provider, while the Guest should reach out to their personal insurance company for potential reimbursement of the damage.
 
Deposit Amendment Notice: Effective DATE
The deposit conditions have been updated to include circumstances under which the host may retain the deposit in the event of an early departure by the guest. This change applies to all bookings confirmed on or after August 16th, 2024. For bookings confirmed before August 16th, 2024, the conditions stated in the Deposit Form provided at the time of booking confirmation will apply.
 
Pre-Check-In Communication Policies
Prior to check-in, guests are encouraged to communicate with the host through various means of digital communication, including but not limited to email, phone, WhatsApp, or any other digital platform. However, guests are required to diligently adhere to the following guidelines to ensure a smooth and respectful interaction with the host:

- Courteous and Timely Communication: Guests must engage with their host respectfully, maintaining the standard relationship between host and guest by refraining from asking personal questions that may be intrusive. Regarding check-in arrangements, guests are requested to respond to their hosts within 48 hours, or sooner if check-in is within the next 48 hours.

- Booking Amendments: Guests should refrain from requesting changes to the terms of the booking, including alterations to the check-in/out dates, rental price, periodicity of rental payment, transfer of the booking to another person, or change on the number of guests occupying the room. 

- Compliance with Terms: Guests must refrain from making requests that are in violation of the terms and conditions, such as seeking permission to bring a visitor, requesting to store an excessive amount of belongings at the host's property, or any other request in violation of the terms and conditions.

- Reasonable Communication Etiquette: Guests are kindly requested to avoid making repetitive requests that have already been addressed or sending an unreasonable number of information requests to their host, even after receiving sufficient help and answers. For instance, repeatedly demanding more room photos when it is not feasible or directing an excessive number of unrelated questions to the host should be avoided.

- Reasonable Request Etiquette: Guests are kindly asked to refrain from making unreasonable requests to the host. This includes, but is not limited to, requesting significant changes to the allocated room, such as altering the type of bed or requesting additional furniture. Guests are also advised against bringing their own furniture or requesting the removal of existing items. This etiquette extends to services considered unreasonable, such as requests for daily transportation to the school, company office, bus stop, or train station of interest to the guest.

- Prior Indication for Special Requests: Guests are requested to refrain from making requests that, while allowed by the terms and conditions, required prior indication during the booking request before the host's booking acceptance. For instance, guests should avoid requesting to work remotely from the property if this intention was not clearly stated in the initial booking request.

- Clear Intention To Proceed With the Booking: Once the booking is confirmed, guests are expected to honor their commitment to stay in the accommodation as per the agreed-upon terms. Once a booking is confirmed, the reserved room or studio becomes unavailable for other potential users to book. Therefore, guests are kindly requested to refrain from indicating to the host any intention to potentially alter their decision or introduce new conditions after the confirmation. This includes statements implying a decision pending a viewing of the accommodation. Any such communication indicating a potential change in intention will be considered as a cancellation of the booking.

- Host Reference and Information Requests: As part of your booking with Warm Welcome  you will be required to provide a valid form of identification, payment authorization, a reason for your stay, and a personal description. Following the confirmation of your booking, your Host may request additional documentation or information to verify accuracy, which may include, references from previous landlords, a university enrollment letter, or a letter of employment. Hosts may also request to verify your identification at check-in. While these requests are optional, they are reasonable and relevant to ensure a safe and secure environment. Guests are requested to cooperate with such requests.

Failure to comply with these guidelines may result in the cancellation of the booking due to miscommunication before check-in, with either no full refund or no refund at all of the service fee — depending on the nature of the breach. If guests are uncertain about the acceptability of a request, we encourage them to contact our customer service team via email at support@warmwelcome.ie for clarification and assistance.

Guest Arrival Date Change on Confirmed Booking
The check-in date refers to the arrival date of the guest at the property, and the check-out date refers to the departure date of the guest from the property. The check-in and check-out dates selected by the guest during the booking process will be confirmed when the host accepts the booking. Guests are strongly encouraged to carefully plan their travel arrangements before making any booking to avoid the need for changes to their check-in or check-out dates.

1) Guest-Initiated Changes to Check-in or Check-out Dates:
If a guest requests a change of check-in or check-out date on a confirmed booking and the host is unable or unwilling to accommodate this change, it may result in the cancellation of the booking. In such cases, the guest will not be eligible for a full refund of the service fee.

2) Host-Initiated Changes to Check-in or Check-out Dates:
If the host changes the check-in and/or check-out date on a confirmed booking, the guest may refuse this amendment and will be offered a full refund of the service fee. If the guest accepts the amendment, the new check-in and/or check-out date will become the new binding dates for the booking and no refund in full will be possible.

3) Rent Payment and Check-in Date:
If the guest has changed their arrival date compared to the confirmed check-in date selected during the booking process, the following will apply:
a) The host cannot charge any rent before the guest's physical arrival at the property, even if the guest has changed their check-in date with the host's approval.
b) If the guest arrives after the initial check-in date selected during the booking process, the rent arrears between the original check-in date and the actual arrival date must be paid upon the guest's arrival at the property.
c) If the guest arrives before the initial check-in date selected during the booking process with the host's approval, the same weekly payment as per the original booking will apply from the arrival date of the guest to cover the period up to the original confirmed check-in date.

4) Rent Payment and Check-out Date:
If the guest leaves before the check-out date selected during the booking process, the host cannot charge any rent for the period after the guest has left and no penalties will be imposed on guests choosing to depart early. However, the paid weekly rental payment is non-refundable and will not be prorated, even if the guest leaves within less than 7 days after their last weekly payment.

In The Event Of A Guest Cancelling Their Booking Request (before it is confirmed by the host).
A booking request is defined as a booking initiated by a guest but has not yet been approved by the host. Consequently, the booking remains unconfirmed.
- The Guest can decide to cancel their booking request before the booking is confirmed by the Host with no charge being deducted from their bank or Paypal account. 
- To cancel a booking request before it is confirmed by the Host, the guest must log in to their guest's account and click the cancel button provided on each application. 

In The Event Of A Guest Cancelling Their Confirmed Booking (before the check-in).
A confirmed booking is defined as a booking initiated by the Guest and approved by the Host. Once approved, the booking is considered fully confirmed.
If a Guest chooses not to check in at the booked property, they must cancel their confirmed booking before the check-in date using their Guest Account.
If the Guest cancels their confirmed booking before the check-in date, neither rent nor deposit will be due to the Host.

In The Event Of A Guest Not Satisfied With Their Accommodation (during their stay).
The satisfaction of our Guests greatly matters to us, please read the information below in the unlikely event of a significant issue with your accommodation, so that we can help you best. 
 
- If the Guest encounters any significant issues with the accommodation or experiences a breach of the terms and conditions by the host, and as a result, is dissatisfied with their stay; they must inform Warm Welcome within one week maximum of the issue arising by sending an email to support@warmwelcome.ie from the email address used for the booking, detailing the situation.
- Warm Welcome will then take immediate and appropriate action to try to solve the Guest's issues. This may include contacting the Host on behalf of the Guest. If it is proven that the Host has failed to comply with the terms and conditions or can't fix the issue reported by the Guest within a reasonable timeframe, the Guest will receive a refund for the unused remaining weeks of the service fee they paid, if they leave the property earlier than their confirmed check-out date.
- If it is determined that there was no fault on the part of the host, or if the guest has breached the terms and conditions of their booking, Warm Welcome will communicate this information to the Guest, providing details collected during the investigation.
 
Flexible Cancellation Policy – Terms & Conditions
We understand that plans can change, and it’s important for us to offer a flexible and fair cancellation policy to support our guests.

If a booking request is cancelled before it is confirmed by the host, guests are eligible for a 100% refund in the form of a payment authorisation cancellation. In this case, no charge is made and the authorisation will be voided — nothing will be deducted from the guest’s bank account.

Once the booking is confirmed by the host, the Warm Welcome  service fee is non-refundable and will be charged in full. However, the guest must cancel the booking before their check-in date to avoid any rent payment or penalty to your host.

Please note that any serious breach of our Terms & Conditions — including inappropriate communication with the host, failure to provide required but permitted information (e.g., intent to work from home), or failure to disclose prohibited information (e.g., intention to bring a pet, which is not allowed in any of our properties) — will result in the booking being cancelled with no refund of the service fee.
All cancellations and refund requests are subject to our full Terms & Conditions.

Legal Notice On The Cancellation Policy
Article 16 of Directive 2011/83/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council of 25 October 2011 states Exceptions from the right of withdrawal as follows: 
“Member States shall not provide for the right of withdrawal set out in Articles 9 to 15 in respect of distance and off-premises Contracts as regards the following: 
a) Service Agreements after the service has been fully performed if the performance has begun with the consumer’s prior express consent, and with the acknowledgement that he/she will lose their right of withdrawal once the Contract has been fully performed by the trader.”
Warm Welcome services are considered fully performed and rendered when the Host has accepted the Booking Request of the Guest; and the Guest has received the Booking Confirmation sent by Warm Welcome by email which includes the Contact Details of the Host. 
Accordingly, the Guest understands, accepts and acknowledges that once the services have been fully rendered (as described above) by Warm Welcome, he/she will have lost their right of withdrawal.

In The Event Of A Guest Not Respecting The Terms And Conditions:
- If the Host can show that the Guest is not adhering to the terms and conditions, is engaging in illegal activities, is rude and/or impolite, then the Host can terminate the hosting before the end of the duration booked without giving any notice. The Guest is expected to respect the terms and conditions from the time of booking, this includes any breach of the terms and conditions by way of correspondence with the Host before check in or a 'no show' by the Guest. Under such circumstances Warm Welcome will not place the Guest in another Warm Welcome home nor will the service fee be refunded to the Guest.  
- If a Guest makes a request to the Host for something which clearly goes against the terms and conditions, this constitutes a breach in the agreement by the Guest (e.g: if, after a booking has been confirmed, the Guest contacts the Host to request that the Host make an exception to permit them to have visitors or stay overnight with them at the Host's home).
 
Guest Placement Refusal Policy
We reserve the right to refuse placement of a guest in any property if there is a history of complaints, even if each complaint is non-critical, where such non-critical complaints originate from multiple hosts across different properties listed on our platform and indicate a recurring pattern of conduct inconsistent with our Terms and Conditions. Complaints may be recorded at any stage, including prior to check-in or where a booking has been cancelled before check-in due to the guest’s conduct breaching the Terms and Conditions during pre-check-in communication. In cases of serious misconduct or a serious breach of our Terms and Conditions, a single complaint from a host shall be sufficient grounds for immediate disqualification from future placements of the guest concerned. Warm Welcome acknowledges that accounts of events may vary and will conduct a careful and impartial review of all relevant information provided by hosts reporting complaints before making a decision to refuse placement to a guest.
 
Exclusion of Responsibility
The Guest understands and accepts that Warm Welcome must rely on the information provided by the Host and that most of the information may be difficult to verify. Warm Welcome will never place a Guest at a property if it is known that any information may lead to suspicious or illegal behaviour from the host, but it must be understood that the behaviour of the Host cannot be guaranteed.
The Guest and Host accept full responsibility and risk for any injury or damage caused during the Guest's placement. The Guest releases and forever discharges Warm Welcome, its respective owners, agents and employees, from all actions, causes of actions, suits, claims, or demands whatsoever, that may arise from the Guest's participation in the placement.

The Host confirms and guarantees that all the points contained in the above have been fully read, understood, and accepted. By agreeing to become a Host on the Warm Welcome Platform, you, the Host, confirm that all the information you have provided is accurate and true and that there is no reason you would not make a suitable Host to Guests.

A Host can be:

The property can be the Host’s main residence or an additional property they own. The Host is not required to live on-site as long as they remain reachable if needed by the Guest for concerns regarding the property.

We do not accept any other host profiles beyond those listed above. Professional agencies or letting agents are strictly prohibited from advertising rooms on behalf of landlords on our platform.

Placement
Warm Welcome does not charge the Host for the services it provides to the Host. Warm Welcome always strives to provide as many Guests as the Host is willing to accept, but cannot guarantee that all the expectations of the Host will be fulfilled and cannot give any guarantee of Guest placement.

Conditions of Hosting
The Host is expected to fully agree to:
- Provide the Guest with full and private use of his/her room, and access to all shared rooms, as designated by the Host, which at the very least should include the main bathroom (if the room doesn't come with a private bathroom) and the kitchen (please see section "Use of The Kitchen" for more information).
- Contact the Guest by email or telephone to introduce themselves, to arrange details of the check in and provide directions to the accommodation if necessary, within 48 hours after the agreed placement with Warm Welcome.

- Give the Guest their own house key from the day of their arrival and to inform them of any existing alarm codes
- Ensure that throughout the Guest’s stay, a responsible person is available and able to perform all of the requirements in this document if the Host is away from home during the Guest's stay.

Under no circumstances are Guests to be solely responsible for the cleaning of the common areas.
- The Guest is not permitted to use the landline, unless there is an emergency that requires them to do so.

House Rules
The Host will be provided with ‘House Rules’ by Warm Welcome which have been designed to help the Host and Guest cohabit more harmoniously. The Host is entitled to apply more specific house rules in addition to those provided by Warm Welcome, once they are reasonable. 

No Curfew
Please note that as all Guests are over 18 years old, a curfew is not to be imposed on them.
 
Low Noise Policy
We kindly request all Guests and Hosts to refrain from creating noise disturbances between the hours of 10 PM and 7 AM. This period is designated for quiet hours to accommodate those who may be sleeping. Please note that this includes refraining from taking showers after 10 PM or before 7 AM if the property is equipped with a showering system that may be particularly noisy when in use, such as electric showers, power showers, or mixer showers etc.

​Furthermore, guests and hosts are prohibited, at any hour of the day or night, from generating noise at an unreasonable level, except in cases of truly unavoidable and exceptional circumstances. We kindly ask all parties to be considerate of their fellow residents and to actively contribute to maintaining a peaceful atmosphere within the property.

Use of the Kitchen
We value guests having access to the kitchen in order to prepare healthy meals for themselves. However, guests must strictly adhere to the following rules while using the kitchen.
​
a) Guests are welcome to use the kitchen and kitchen utensils to cook their meals during the following times:
- From 6 am to 9 am (breakfast) - From 12 noon to 2 pm (lunch) - From 5 pm to 10 pm (dinner).
b) Cooking is not allowed outside of these cooking hours.
c) Cooking hours can be further restricted from the times above if the host or other guests need to prepare their own meals. In such cases, the host must clearly inform each guest about the exact time they can use the kitchen while allowing every guest a reasonable amount of time to cook and eat their meals.
d) Guests will still have access to the kitchen outside of the cooking hours to access the fridge or to prepare themselves a sandwich etc.
e) Guests are expected to clean their dishes immediately after having their meals and to leave the kitchen clean.
f) The kitchen is to be used for cooking and eating purposes only, it is not permitted to study etc. in the kitchen.

Food Restriction Policy
The host retains the right to regulate the preparation or consumption of specific foods within the property premises, considering factors like allergies, personal beliefs, environmental concerns, or animal welfare principles. This may encompass items like meat, fish, eggs, and dairy products. Strong-smelling items, including specific spices, may also be subject to strict restrictions, especially if any member of the household experiences asthma, respiratory problems, or is very sensitive to the air quality in close environments. However, hosts must take into account if guests explicitly communicate their need for certain food types in their booking request, particularly when these items are essential for their consumption, before accepting or declining a booking.
 
Laundry Facilities Policy
a) Washing Machine:
The Hosts are required to provide Guests with access to a washing machine within the property. Guests are responsible for laundering their personal clothes, towels, and linens, necessitating use of the provided washing machine. The number of weekly washes is limited to 2 (twice a week) for environmental conservation and compliance with the washing machine manufacturer's recommendations regarding optimal load size. This bi-weekly usage includes all Guest's personal clothes, bed linens, and towels. The Host retains the right to establish specific times and rules for washing machine usage, ensuring they permit reasonable access. The Host has the option to manage the Guest's laundry on their behalf, provided that such assistance is undertaken only with the explicit consent of the Guest. It is crucial to understand that Guests can decline this service for privacy reasons and may decide to handle their own laundry themselves.
 
b) Dryer and Drying Rack:
The Hosts are not obligated to grant Guests access to the dryer (if available), but they must allocate a space where Guests can dry their clothes. Alternatively, Guests may be allowed to dry their clothes in their room if suitable. The Host is required to provide Guests with access to suitable drying rack equipment.


Heating, Energy and Water Use
Hosts are required to maintain a sufficient temperature in the house during the coldest months of the year by heating the house in the evenings and early mornings.

Guests must be mindful of appropriate heating, energy and water savings by:
- Not requesting that their host maintain unreasonable room temperatures. As recommended by the SEAI*, the temperature in the living area should not exceed 20°C and the temperature in bedrooms should be between 15 and 18°C. 
- Not requesting heating outside of the heating hours (eg: if guests choose to stay home during the day on weekdays to study or work).
- Not changing heating settings themselves; any necessary changes must be requested to be made by the hosts.
- Not installing nor using any of their own heating devices.
- Switching off all appliances when not using them and turning off all lights when leaving a room. 
​- Keeping shower duration to a maximum of 4 to 5 mins.

* SEAI is Ireland's national sustainable energy authority. They were founded in 2002 to address environmental challenges and help households and communities to use less energy. 


Visitors
Guests are strictly prohibited from bringing visitors to the property, at any time during their stay. Furthermore, asking a Host to make an exception on this rule will be considered a breach of the Warm Welcome Terms and Conditions.
 
Guest Room/Studio Care and Hygiene Standards
We kindly ask our guests to keep their allocated bedrooms or studios clean, tidy, and well-maintained throughout their stay. To ensure proper hygiene, food consumption in the bedroom is strictly prohibited. Additionally, guests are requested to open their windows for ventilation at least once a day for 5 to 10 minutes to maintain air quality and prevent moisture buildup (see section below for more details on ventilation). Furthermore, it's advised to change and launder bed linens, including sheets and pillowcases, within a maximum timeframe of one to two weeks to maintain optimal hygiene. 

Ventilation and Air Quality in the Allocated Rooms and Studios
As recommended by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), proper ventilation is essential for optimising indoor air quality, preventing excess moisture, and maintaining a healthy environment for both the room and its guests. It is the responsibility of each guest to open the window of their allocated room or studio at least once a day for a minimum of 5 to 10 minutes, allowing fresh air to circulate and maintaining optimal air quality. This daily practice helps prevent issues such as condensation, mould growth, and other related concerns, ensuring a comfortable and safe living space.

Some guests may wish to use devices such as humidifiers or air purifiers. However, it is important to note that these devices are not a substitute for daily window ventilation. Guests must inform their hosts in advance if they intend to use such devices, particularly, but not limited to, electrical ones, as these may pose security risks. 

Failure to comply with the ventilation guidelines will be considered a breach of the Terms and Conditions, and any resulting damage to the room or studio will be the guest's responsibility.
 
Guest Room Privacy
Guest privacy is very important and the room allocated to the guest is to be considered their own private room for the entire duration of their stay. 
Accordingly, the host can only access the guest's room for safety purposes, such as checking if no electrical appliances such as radiators were left on, if the window was properly closed, if the room is kept tidy etc.
 
Smoking Policy
Guests are strictly prohibited from smoking in any part of the indoor premises. Smoking is only allowed in designated outdoor spaces, if available. This policy includes all forms of smoking, such as cigarettes, cigars, pipes, electronic cigarettes, and any other smoking devices.
 
If the host is a smoker, it is imperative that they adhere to the following guidelines to maintain a smoke-free environment for all guests. The host may only smoke in their own private room or living room, which must not be shared with guests under any circumstances. It is essential for the host to ensure that their smoking does not impact any other part of the property, including adjacent rooms, common areas, or shared spaces. The host must take necessary precautions to prevent the transmission of smoke or any associated odors to non-smoking areas.


Rental Payment
Each Host will receive rental payment made by the Guest on a weekly basis.
-The payment for the first week’s stay with the Host will be paid upfront, on the day of arrival.
- Each rental payment will be made on the same day of the week that the Guest arrived, and so on until the end of the placement.
- The Host is not authorised to charge any additional fees to the Guests, all bills, WiFi when available and use of the washing machine are accounted for in the agreed rent figure.
- The rent can't be increased during the guest's stay. 
- Neither Guest nor Host may lend or borrow money from each other.
 
Payment Method
By default, rent is payable in cash. If there is no specific agreement or discussion between the Host and the Guest regarding the payment method, cash will be the method of payment for the entire duration of the Guest's stay. However, upon mutual agreement between the host and the guest, the method of payment can be changed to a bank transfer. In the case of a bank transfer, the guest must initiate the transfer on the due date of their weekly rent (and not before). If the transfer of funds to the host's bank account is not instant (such as with online banks like Revolut, etc.), the guest must provide proof to their host, on the day the weekly rent is due, that the bank transfer has been made, in the form of a screenshot or payment confirmation document from their bank.
 
Deposit
1 - Deposit Collect at Check-in and Purpose: 
The guest is required to provide a deposit as stated in the deposit form on the day of arrival. The Host is responsible for collecting and refunding the deposit directly to the Guest during the check-out.
 
The deposit is designed to provide protection for the host against potential damages caused by the Guest during their stay to the property or to any of the property's items. Additionally, it covers any missing past rental payments for the duration the guest has stayed at the property.
 
Please note that this deposit serves a distinct purpose as indicated in this document and should under no circumstances be treated as an additional payment for room rental, nor be retained to address other matters that may arise between the Guest and the Host.
 
Please note that the deposit cannot be used by the guest as a substitute for the final week’s rent payment.


2 - Deposit Retention for Early Departure Without Notice:
Guests are required to provide formal notice to the host at least 1 week before their revised departure date if they plan to leave the accommodation earlier than their confirmed check-out date. If a guest departs early without giving the required 1-week notice minimum, the host may retain the deposit to cover the rental loss resulting from the early check-out.
 
Guests should send their notice to the host in writing, either by email or text message, and should retain a copy of the notice for their records.
 
Exceptions When Notice Is Not Required:
a) The host has breached the Terms and Conditions of the booking, leading to the guest’s early departure.
b) The host has exhibited unwelcoming behaviour towards the guest, causing the guest to leave early.
c) The host has formally requested or suggested that the guest leave before the end of their booked stay.
 
Note that the guest must provide the host with clear and detailed information supporting one or more of the reasons above if they believe they are entitled to receive their deposit back without giving the 1-week notice.


3 - Deposit Return Procedure and Potential Damages Check:
During check-out, both the Guest and the Host must inspect the guest's allocated bedroom together.

If no damage is identified, the deposit must be returned in full to the guest immediately after the check-out is completed.

In the Event That Damages Are Discovered:
- If any damage is discovered, or if any pre-existing damage to the property or its items has been directly caused by the Guest, the Host and the Guest should document it together, including taking photographs for records.
- The Host and the Guest must then work together to make a realistic estimate of the repair costs, which can be done through an internet search or by consulting professionals qualified to repair the damage.
- If the repair cost is less than the deposit amount, the remaining balance must be returned to the guest.
- If the repair cost exceeds the deposit amount, the Host should contact their home insurance provider, while the Guest should reach out to their personal insurance company for potential reimbursement of the damage.
 
Deposit Amendment Notice: Effective August 16th, 2024
The deposit conditions have been updated to include circumstances under which the host may retain the deposit in the event of an early departure by the guest. This change applies to all bookings confirmed on or after August 16th, 2024. For bookings confirmed before August 16th, 2024, the conditions stated in the Deposit Form provided at the time of booking confirmation will apply.
 
Early Termination Initiated by The Host
We understand that a host may decide or need to terminate their guest's stay earlier than their booked period for personal reasons or new unexpected circumstances outside of their control, or need to terminate earlier due to the guest not respecting the terms and conditions of their booking. The following rules will apply:

a) While no specific notice for early booking termination is imposed on the host as it might not always be possible to do so, it is recommended that the host provide a minimum of 2 weeks' termination notice to their guest when possible.
b) Hosts are requested to notify Warm Welcome at support@warmwelcome.ie as soon as they know they need to terminate the stay of their guest at an earlier date and to advise their guest to do the same. 

Early Termination Initiated by The Guest
We understand that a guest may decide or need to leave before the end of the check-out date they selected and which was confirmed by their host—whether for personal reasons or unexpected circumstances outside of their control. The following rules will apply:

a) Guests are required to give their host the longest notice possible if they know they are leaving earlier than their booked check-out date. While we understand that providing a long notice period may not always be feasible, this notice must be at least 7 days.
b) To be valid, early departure notice must be sent by email to both the host and Warm Welcome  at support@warmwelcome.ie, clearly stating the new departure date. This allows us to promptly re-advertise the room on the host’s behalf.
c) If a guest provides no notice at all and leaves the property earlier than their booked check-out date with immediate effect, the rent will remain due for 7 days from the date they left the property. 
For example: If a guest departs without notice 3 days after paying their 7-day weekly rent, an additional 3 days of rent will be charged to meet the required 7-day notice period.
d) If a guest provides notice, but it is less than 7 days before their early departure, rent will remain due for the number of days falling short of the 7-day notice period.
For example: If the guest gives 6 days’ notice, they will be charged 1 extra day of rent beyond the new departure date.
e) It is to be noted that even in cases where a guest fails to provide notice or provides less than the required 7 days’ notice, if the original check-out date is less than 7 days from the new departure date, rent will only be due up to the original check-out date.
For example: If the original check-out is in 4 days and the guest leaves immediately without giving any notice, rent is due for those 4 days—not 7.
f) The notice requirement may be waived if the guest leaves early due to a significant breach of terms by the host, provided the guest clearly informs the host of the issue and the host has either refused or failed to resolve it.

In The Event Of A Host Not Respecting The Terms And Conditions:
If the Host doesn't respect the terms and conditions as set up in this document or doesn't respect the standards of conduct, the Guest may terminate the placement without advance notice and without any extra cost to the Guest. The Host will refund the Guest prorated amounts paid together with the deposit and with no deductions taken before the termination date. 
Warm Welcome reserves the right to remove any Host listings upon failure to adhere to the above terms and conditions.


Communication Protocols and Privacy Measures
To uphold the utmost privacy and security of our Hosts, Warm Welcome places great importance on safeguarding their personal information. Therefore, we will exclusively respond to specific queries if the inquiry is received from the same email address used to create the Host's account. This stringent measure is in place to ensure that only the authorized Host, as identified by their registered email, has access to pertinent details about their listing and host's account arrangements.
In the event that the email address initially used by the Host to initiate the creation of their host's account becomes inaccessible, a change of email address is permissible. To facilitate this change, the Host must clearly explain the situation by contacting support@warmwelcome.ie. Additionally, the request for a change the email address must be accompanied by a valid copy of identification or a utility bill issued within the last twelve months, ensuring it matches the other contact details provided during the application to become a host.
 
Photos Provided By The User
Hosts are responsible for providing accurate and representative photos of their room and property for advertising purposes. It is important that these photos are up to date and of good quality, meeting the standards of an average camera or smartphone. The photos should accurately represent the room and property, showcasing them in their true colors without the use of filters, alterations, or black and white effects that may misrepresent their appearance. Hosts are encouraged to showcase their space in the best possible light while ensuring transparency and fairness to potential guests. By providing good quality, accurate representation photos, hosts can enhance the trust and credibility of their listings, leading to a more positive booking experience for both hosts and guests.


Photo Release 
The Host agrees to the use of photographs submitted to Warm Welcome or sent by the host, of their property. These photos will be used to create the Hosts online profile and may be used in promotion of the service in social media, advertising and other third party forums. 
 
Verified Address Information
Hosts can verify their address by submitting a recent utility bill (gas, electricity, landline, or broadband) or a bank letter/statement, each dated within the last three months. Alternatively, they can provide a current car or home insurance policy, a tenancy agreement, or a Tax Credit Certificate.
A government-issued ID or passport cannot be used to verify an address and is accepted solely for identity verification purposes.
All submitted documents will be handled in accordance with applicable privacy and data protection regulations and will be used exclusively for verification of the host’s address. Listings that have completed address verification will be marked as “Address Verified”, which helps create a safe and trustworthy environment for both hosts and guests and can enhance the host’s profile.
 
Room Allocation Policy
The Host must be committed to providing the Guest with the specific room as indicated in the listing. In the event that circumstances beyond the host's control necessitate the assignment of a different room to the guest, the host must inform the guest before the check-in date to properly inform them and seek their acceptance of the new room allocated.
 
It is important to note the following exceptions, where the room will still fall within the terms and conditions of the booking and will not be considered as a different room:
- In the event that an alternative room is allocated but constitutes an upgrade (larger size, private ensuite bathroom instead of a shared bathroom, etc.) or is similar (same size and same bathroom situation, etc.) to the initially reserved accommodation, and is provided at the same rental price.
- Similarly, a room that has undergone renovation for improvement purposes will also not be classified as a different room.
 
Storage Space & Stored Item Rules
Guests must be provided with at least one storage space in their room, such as a wardrobe, chest of drawers, shelves, shelving unit, clothing rack, or under-bed storage.
If the host has limited storage options elsewhere in the property, they may use additional available storage space in the guest's room for their own belongings. However, this must be for items that are not used frequently. The host must limit access to the guest's room to retrieve these items to an absolute minimum, ensuring the guest’s privacy is respected.
 
Host's Address Usage Policy
Guests are allowed to use the host's address for essential administrative purposes, specifically for Visa requirements, opening a bank account in Ireland, and applying for the PPS number.
 
For non-essential matters like receiving parcels, private correspondence, etc., guests must seek prior authorization from the host. It is expected that guests keep the volume of mail sent to the host's address low. The host can refuse guests the use of their address for purposes outside of the three essential ones listed above.
Additionally, guests are not allowed to send any letters or parcels to the host's address before their check-in.
